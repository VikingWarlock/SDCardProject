### SDCard Test Project

#### This time, the task is far more hard than last one.

We are asked to read data from SDCard, select an image, and display on the view.

Invovled:

    Intent
    SDCard

#### Well, I didn't use teacher's code, so I don't know that `Choose image from SDCard` can be done by Android's origin API.

#### So, I myself write a Class called `SDHelper` to fetch image data from SDCard...

In order to make this app looks beautiful, I use GridView. This is tough...Spent me totally 3 hours at least.

Then I learn to use Intent to do the callback.

Well, I think I love Android now...

### Attention

#### This project should use a Third Part Library to display Image asynchronously.

You'd better use `Android Studio`
